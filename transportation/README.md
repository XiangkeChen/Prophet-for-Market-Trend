Problem Statement:
Unicorns are considering making an investment in a new form of transportation - JetRail. JetRail uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed! While JetRail has mastered the technology and they hold the patent for their product, the investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users with in next 18 months.
 
We need to help Unicorn ventures with the decision, who usually invests in B2C start-ups less than 4 years old looking for pre-series A funding. In order to help Unicorn Ventures in their decision, we need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months. 

The dataset is traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file.

We use Prophet to do the prediction.
